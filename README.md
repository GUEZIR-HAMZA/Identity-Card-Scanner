## Description

This project consists of a full-stack application with a Django backend API and front-end interfaces developed using React Native for mobile and React.js for the web. The primary functionality involves file uploads through the API endpoint `http://localhost:8000/api/upload/`. The backend is responsible for handling these uploads, while the React Native and React.js front ends provide user interfaces for interacting with the application.
